# Furhat DEMO skill

This is an example-skill aiming to:

1. Show developers how they can structure their projects as they grow in size
2. Showcase various functionality of the Furhat robot
3. Invite Furhat owners to use the skill as-is or customized to demo their Furhat robot to other people

## Running the skill

1. Clone the repository, `git clone https://github.com/FurhatRobotics/demo-skill`
2. In IntelliJ IDEA, import the skill as a new gradle project (or module if you have an existing project) (use the _from existing source_ alternative and select the _build.gradle_ file)
3. Make sure you have the Furhat SDK development server or a robot running.
4. Run the skill by the main method in the skill's `main.kt` file. If you want to run on a robot, see [follow this section in the docs](https://docs.furhat.io/skills/#running-a-skill-on-a-robot)
